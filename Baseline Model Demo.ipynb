       "'In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn\\'t come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn\\'t a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a \\'Shawshank\\' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on \"that \\'Rickshaw\\' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film\\'s a nightmare, as \\'prison drama\\' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn\\'t spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, \"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It\\'s in music, it\\'s in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here\\'s where you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don\\'t forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren\\'t made out of stone. That there\\'s a - there\\'s a - there\\'s something inside that\\'s yours, that they can\\'t touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn\\'t think much of Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o\\' milk with the silver spoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film\\'s major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it\\'s a feeling that weighs so much into everyone\\'s day to day lives. Perhaps it\\'s too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank\\'s core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It\\'s pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie\\'s timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it\\'s not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it\\'s going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren\\'t looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don\\'t come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb\\'s Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven\\'t seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.\"'"

       "'In Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written directed Frank Darabont, novella Rita Hayworth Shawshank Redemption, Stephen King) nominated seven Academy Awards, walked away zero. Best Picture went Forrest Gump, Shawshank Pulp Fiction \"just happy nominated.\" Of course hindsight 20/20, history looks back Gump good film, Pulp Redemption remembered all-time best. Pulp, however, success word \"go,\" making huge splash Cannes making writer-director American master two films. For Andy Dufresne Co., success come easy. Fortunately, failure life sentence.After opening 33 screens take $727,327, $25M film fell fast theatres finished mere $28.3M. The reasons failure many. Firstly, title clunker. While iconic fans today, 1994, people knew cared \\'Shawshank\\' was. On DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating \"that \\'Rickshaw\\' movie.\" Marketing-wise, film\\'s nightmare, \\'prison drama\\' tough sell women, story love two best friends spell winner men. Worst all, movie slow molasses. As Desson Thomson writes Washington Post, \"it wanders subplots every opportunity ignores abundance narrative exit points settling finale.\" But weaknesses make film strong.Firstly, setting. The opening aerial shots prison total eye-opener. This amazing piece architecture, strong Gothic design. Immediately, prison becomes character. It casts shadow film, tall stone walls stretching every shot. It towers men contains, blotting memories outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It\\'s music, sandy beaches Zihuatanejo; \"In here\\'s need most,\" says. \"You need forget. Forget places world made stone. That there\\'s - there\\'s - there\\'s something inside that\\'s yours, can\\'t touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) think much Andy first, picking \"that tall glass o\\' milk silver spoon ass\" first new fish crack. Andy says word, losing bet, Red resents it. But time, two get know other, quickly become best friends. This again, one film\\'s major strengths. Many movies love, many flicks side-kick hero, Shawshank one I think looks honestly love two best friends. It seems odd Hollywood would skip relationship time again, feeling weighs much everyone\\'s day day lives. Perhaps sentimental seem conventional, Shawshank\\'s core friendship hits right notes, film much better it.It\\'s pacing deliberate well. As spend film watching actors, easy forget movie\\'s timeline spans well 20 years. Such huge measure time would pass slowly reality, would amplified prison. And film lacks interest moments. It still knows going, merely intends taking sweet time getting there. It pays well, tedium prison life makes climax much exhilarating. For anyone sees it, moment never forgotten.With themes faith hope, definite religious subtext found here. Quiet, selfless carefree, Andy obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) obviously modeled Richard Nixon, who, day, close personified Satan come. But looking subtexts, movie speaks anyone search hope. It compelling drama, moving film, perfectly written, acted shot. They come much better this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served message hope Hollywood well. More film memory, proved life box office. Besting Forrest Fiction, ran solely strong word mouth became hottest rented film 1995. It currently sits #2 IMDb\\'s Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots The Godfather top ranked film time -- redemption indeed. If seen yet, hell waiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes simple choice, really. Either get busy living, get busy dying.\"'"
